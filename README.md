# Integration Testing with Permissions

Flutter issue [#12561](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/12561)
describes problems with running Flutter Driver when there are apps that require
permissions.

This sample demonstrates how to work around these issues. It's integration tests
must get location permission to pass. (The unit test uses a mock version of the
`location` plugin.)

## Run on an Android device using Flutter Driver:

Use the `adb` command to enable the permssions needed in your tests before 
running `flutter drive`:

```bash
adb shell pm grant <appId> android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION
adb shell pm grant <appId> android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION

flutter drive \
  --driver=integration_test/driver.dart \
  --target=integration_test/location_test.dart \
  -d <deviceId>
```

You can determine which permissions you need to set by referencing the
[Manifest.permission documentation][android-permissions]. Use this command for
any permission with the "dangerous" level to prevent the app from displaying a
dialog.

## Run on an iOS device Flutter Driver:

Install [AppleSimulatorUtils](https://github.com/wix/AppleSimulatorUtils):

```
brew tap wix/brew
brew install applesimutils
```

Run `applesimutils` to enable permissions before running `flutter drive`:

```bash
applesimutils --byId <deviceId> --bundle <appId> --setPermissions location=always

flutter drive \
  --driver=integration_test/driver.dart \
  --target=integration_test/location_test.dart \
  -d <deviceId>
```


## Tips
- Set the iOS location by opening the Simulator and selecting Features ->
  Location -> Custom Location.
- The iOS bundle identifier is camelCase (`com.example.integrationTestPermissions`) and
  Android app ID is snake_case (`com.example.integration_test_permissions`)
- See the full list of Android permissions [Manifest.permission
  documentation][android-permissions]
- See the full list of iOS permissions by running `applesimutils --help`
